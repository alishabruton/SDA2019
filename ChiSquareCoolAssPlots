#Week 5 class notes. Notes on chi-square from: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r

# Import the data
file_path <- "http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/data/housetasks.txt"
housetasks <- read.delim(file_path, row.names = 1)
head(housetasks)

#Install gplots package. Convert the data as a table, and then as a graph. 
install.packages("gplots")
library(gplots)

#Table. Not a visual, you're just creating a variable here you use to make a balloon plot of. 
dt <- as.table(as.matrix(housetasks))

# Graph. Worked. Looks AWESOME. #Showmargins=FALSE hides the column and row totals. 
balloonplot(t(dt), main ="housetasks", xlab ="", ylab="",
            label = FALSE, show.margins = FALSE)

#You can also view a contingency table as a mosaic plot. Use function mosaicplot() 
#from the built-in R package graphics.
library("graphics")
mosaicplot(dt, shade = TRUE, las=2,
           main = "housetasks")

#Note that the surface of an element of the mosaic reflects the relative magnitude of its value. 
#Blue color indicates that the observed value is higher than the expected value if the data were random. 
#Red color specifies that the observed value is lower than the expected value if the data were random.

#Easier way to do a Pearson's chi-square. 
chisq<- chisq.test(housetasks)
chisq

#Can look at observed and expected counts. 
#observed. 
chisq$observed

#Expected. 
round(chisq$expected,2)

#Get Pearson residuals. 
round(chisq$residuals, 3)

#Visualize Pearson residuals with the package corrplot. SO COOL LOOKING!!! 
#For a given cell, the size of the circle is proportional to the amount of the cell contribution. 
#Positive residuals are in blue, and negative residuals are in red.  
install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(chisq$residuals, is.cor = FALSE)

#Find the contribution in percentages. 
# Contibution in percentage (%)
contrib <- 100*chisq$residuals^2/chisq$statistic
round(contrib, 3)

# Visualize the contribution
corrplot(contrib, is.cor = FALSE)

#Print p-value and mean. 
# printing the p-value
chisq$p.value
# printing the mean
chisq$estimate
