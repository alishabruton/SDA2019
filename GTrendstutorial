#Set the search terms you're interested in. 
#Note that the second argument gprop=web means we're searching web (other options include news, 
images, youtube, and froogle [shopping]). 
#The third argument time=all means we're searching from 2004 to now. Other time options 
include now 1-d, now 7-d, today 1-m, today 3-m, today 12-m, today+5-y. A final possibility for
time is to specify a custom date range e.g. 2010-12-31 2011-06-30. 
#This looks at google searches over the entire world.

#This should give you a table with two columns- dates and numbers. The numbers are RVUs, 
a number between 1-100 which quantifies how common this search was compared to all 
searches which could be done. It doesn't tell you how many searches were done with this 
term. So you can't measure the number of searches, just how the searches changed over time. 

#You may see a warning if your time zone is not set. Fix with this code: 
Sys.setenv(TZ = "UTC")

#Set country codes if you want to search only in particular countries. This searches for 
Canada (CA) and New Zealand (NZ), from June 2010-June 2017.

#You can find the country codes on Wikipedia. States are done like this: US-CA for 
California, etc. You can also use this code to retrieve the codes. This one retrieves 
all the codes for Italy (IT).

#This should give you a lovely plot with the interest over time for each of the 
three search terms. 
#You may have some outliers, for example, if there was something in the news that 
caused a huge spike in one of the searches. 
#This allows you to remove any entry of hits (searches) >100 in order to remove 
the high outliers. 100 would be the highest possible value, so setting it to 100 
doesn't change anything, but you can look at the data yourself and decide what 
cut off point to use.
